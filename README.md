## ✨ Key Features

- 📱 **100% Viewport Limit (Zero Vertical Scrolling)**  
  Designed specifically for mobile devices (`100vh` / `100svh`). All factors, prominent profit projections, and action buttons fit cleanly on a single screen without requiring the user to scroll up or down.

- 👵 **Boomer-Friendly & Ultra-Intuitive Typography**  
  Features extra-large typography, high-contrast charcoal text (`#0f172a`) on crisp white cards (`#ffffff`), and conversational wording (*"Package Price"*, *"Photo Prints"*, *"Staff Helpers"*, *"Gas & Travel"*).

- 🎨 **Modern Light Green QC Aesthetic**  
  Inspired by clean mobile procedure wizards, featuring soft circular/pill minus (`-`) grey steppers and vibrant emerald green plus (`+`) steppers (`#059669`).

- 🔄 **Tab Bar Mode Switcher (Two Distinct Business Models)**  
  Switch instantly between two operational modes without losing your viewport limit:
  - **💼 Package Rental Mode**: For when clients hire Litrato Studio for a fixed event package fee (`Package Price`).
  - **🏪 Retail Booth Mode (Pay-Per-Print)**: For when Litrato Studio rents a venue space and profits based directly on individual copies/prints sold (`Selling Price` × `Copies Sold`). Includes a prominent **Break-Even Point readout** telling your mom exactly how many copies she must sell before making a profit!

- ⚙️ **Dual-Factor Dynamic Adjusters**  
  No hidden hardcoded constants! Every operational factor across both modes can be modified right on the fly:
  - **Package Mode**: Adjust `Package Price`, `Print Volume` & `Print Cost`, `Staff Headcount` & `Helper Pay`, and `Gas & Travel`.
  - **Retail Booth Mode**: Adjust `Selling Price` & `Copies Sold`, `Space Rental Fee`, `Staff Headcount` & `Helper Pay`, and `Print Prod Cost` & `Gas/Travel`.

- 🇵🇭 **Single Currency (`₱` PHP Exclusively)**  
  Streamlined exclusively for Philippine Pesos to eliminate confusing currency toggles.

- 📋 **One-Click Summary Sharing**  
  Includes a **Copy Summary** button that formats the financial breakdown into a clean, emoji-styled text summary ready to be pasted directly into SMS, Viber, or WhatsApp.
